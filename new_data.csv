741,"2023 February 3, 9:11PM",Joshua Fimmano,Product Research,1,1,1,1,"I am very disappointed. I have been doing product research for months now and Joshua decided which products out of 25 are viable in a 18 minute phone call. He too less then half a second to make decision in each product. Also he didn't even go to the entire product list. This is utterly disturbing and disappointing for me. Throughout the call I had not opportunity to discuss the viability of each of my products on the spreadsheet. I could tell
that Joshua didn't  even looked at my product spreadsheet before the zoom call. He has page 2 of the spreadsheet open (without realising there are another 15 product on page 1 of the spreadsheet) during the call and just randomly opening the product research links and decided whether it's a viable product or not in a split second.

 It seemed to me that Joshua had no interest in helping me to set up a successful e-commerce store like what  6fds claims. Above all I paid 6fds for a service and 6fds have failed to deliver it. I spent months on product research and you guys make a decision on whether a product is viable or not in less then half a second. I maybe new to e-commerce business but I have been working in the legal department for years and I know how things work. This whole claim of a successful e-commerce store program seem to me a hoax. I have no faith in you guys anymore. 

 I have paid a fee to 6fds for a service which 6fds have failed to delivered. As a customer I'm not satisfied with your service and I want my money ($3000) back. 

Before I approach third parties I would appreciate if you refund the fee that I paid for your disappointing service. 

I have not interest in remaining anonymous. My name is Moi Barthakur. I had a product research meeting with Joshua on 3 February at 10.10 am Melb time.","Improve customer service.

I asked him a couple of questions and they were answered very quickly.  I was left with many doubts that were not clarified.  

I would like to have another call but with another coach.

After weeks of finding products and feeling a little deflated during the process we were excited for our coaching call.  Making sure to check the time allocated was NZ time (which it was).  Im not sure what happened but it was pushed out to 5pm then an email to say not to worry about the call that Louie would go over the spreadsheet and choose our products.  

He did that and we're grateful but it would have been nice to actually talk to him about it.  Anyway we'll move on to the next step which we're excited about.
